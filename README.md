# Assembly-Test programs

Assembly codes of simple operations like loops and conditions.


Machine code is very hard to follow because it uses binary code to represent the instructions. To provide a more human friendly version of machine code, assembly language is used.
An assembly language statement is a line of text that translates into a single machine instruction.

Assembly Language is expressed in a more human readable form than the binary instructions and names are allowed for memory locations, registers, operations etc.
